# Predicting-Hospital-Readmission
Capstone Project - Predicting Hospital Readmission of Diabetic patients
Part 1: Data Cleaning and EDA
Part 2: Machine Learning Model

# Project Objective
The purpose of this project is to identify the predictor that leads to higher hospital readmission and further identify the patients with higher risk. The target variable is "readmitted".

# Data Description
The dataset was collected by the Center for Clinical and Translational Research, Virginia Commonwealth University .
The dataset contains 100,000 observations and 50 columns such as age, race, gender, tons of tests and medications, and a column to indicate if the patients has been readmitted to hospital within 30 days, after 30 days or never readmitted.
